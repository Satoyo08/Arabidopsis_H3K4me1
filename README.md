# Arabidopsis_H3K4me1
Codes used for 'Transcription-coupled and epigenome-encoded mechanisms direct H3K4 methylation (2022)'

for codes for Supplementary Figure.5, please see Figure2 and 3.r

for codes for Supplementary Figure 9,10,11, please see Figure4.r

## update 2024.01.11
Upon multiple requests, we added the following list of genes in data/list_of_genes folder.
- ATX1/2/R7-marked genes
- ATX3/4/5-marked genes
- ATXR3-marked genes
- ATX1-bound genes 
- ATX2-bound genes
- ATXR7-bound genes

As a note for reproducibility, those lists can also be generated (as R object) by running Figure1.R L58- for ATX*-marked genes, and by Supplementary_Figure3.R L8- for ATX*-bound genes.

- **Are you looking for the formatted data table behind scatter plot of Figure1. d?** Please use data/Figure1/ChIP1_RPKM.txt and data/Figure1/ChIP1_RPM.txt.
- Are you looking for browser tracks? Sorry, we didn't upload them in GEO nor here (we might in future)-  tell us (soya[at]ucdavis.edu) what you need and we'll email you.

Can't find what you are looking for? Pardon my bad code annotation! Please ask via issue section of github or contact soya[at]ucdavis.edu ;)
